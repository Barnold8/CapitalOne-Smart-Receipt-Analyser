## Abstract

As the pressures of inflation and the cost of living increase, it is becoming increasingly important for people to be able to easily and efficiently keep track of their spending. Our project is an application which allows a user to scan their shopping receipts with their phone. The app will then analyse the receipt, extracting each item on it, together with its price. These items are then processed, automatically sorting each item into categories such as 'Food & Drink', 'Entertainment', etc. This data is then presented to the user within the application using charts and graphs, allowing them to visualise what they are spending money on and where they can make any reductions. The user can see their spending broken down by category over the past week/month, as well as review their spending on a particular day. Even though our algorithm is able to predict categories for items it has not encountered before relatively well, the dataset used may still be updated and expanded as needed, making our solution future-proof and allowing the possibility of expansion into other markets.
